This app was built to meet the [rubric requirements](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/109/view) of Udacity's first project of the nd802 Nanodegree. The app was built using [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/). 


## In order to deploy this app you follow the following steps :

### Install Meteor

### Locate terminal on the right folder and deploy

Once in the right directory, just type the `meteor` command, your app will be deployed on http://localhost:3000/. You can visualize the flow in [this example](https://www.meteor.com/tutorials/blaze/creating-an-app).

## Notes on deployment 

Based on what's noted in the [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/109/view): 

> If the build process is not simplistic to setup, check if the student has provided a link to a live application.

This note is to state the build process with Meteor is fairly simplistic. According to the [docs](https://guide.meteor.com/build-tool.html): 

> The Meteor build tool is what compiles, runs, deploys, and publishes all of your Meteor apps and packages. It’s Meteor’s built-in solution to the problems also solved by tools like Grunt, Gulp, Webpack, Browserify, Nodemon, and many others, and uses many popular Node.js tools like Babel and UglifyJS internally to enable a seamless experience.

Please do feel free to contact me if you run into any issues deploying.
